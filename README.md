# Comp-431-HW
Internet Services &amp; Protocols Homework

The overall project of the course was to construct a basic SMTP Client/Server program, which was done in a series of progressive steps that culminate into the final HW5

Homework 1: This homework was intended to assure that when processing SMTP protocol messages, that it accepted properly 
formatted strings via the use of regular expressions

Homework 2: An extension of homework 1, adding in more of the SMTP protocol verification as well as a parser to write protocol
messages into files that are human readable

Homework 3: This is a reverse of homeworks 1 and 2, in that this homework was meant to simulate the server side operations of the SMTP 

Homework 5: In the final installment, we combined homeworks (1-2) with 3 and implemented a server socket. Client could originate messages, and the server would receive messages, and then the intended client would received its message, placing it in a file local to the client. For this last homework we were asked to pull our classes into solely the Client and Server files to make grading/testing easier.
